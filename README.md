# Introduction
This is my study notes for AZ 500. As we know, Microsoft Azure exams are constantly updated. For your reference, I am using the updated list from March 23, 2021 and my notes are up-to-date as of April 2021. Feel free to reference for your own study but if you are here after a year, you most likely want to check if my notes are still relevant. Enjoy!
