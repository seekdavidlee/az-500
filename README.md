# 1.0 Introduction
This is my study notes for AZ 500. I find it particularly useful as I am studying, to watch presentations from experts who has made videos on YouTube versus reading up the docs. Hence, you will find lots of video references below VS notes. As a disclaimer, my list may NOT include everything mentioned in skills measured doc and may NOT include everything you need to understand a particular topic, so please check!

As we know, the Azure Platform is constantly being updated, which means that the Azure exams are also constantly updated. As such, it is important to check if my notes are still applicable to you. For your reference, I am using the updated exam list from March 23, 2021 and my notes are up-to-date as of April 2021. 

Anyway, feel free to reference for your own study! Good luck and enjoy!

## 1.1 The Exam
| Description | Weight | Notes |
| --- | --- | -- |
| Manage identity and access | 30-35% | AAD/ Identity/ Application Access/ Access Control |
| Implement platform protection | 15-20% | Network/ Compute Security |
| Manage security operations | 25-30% | Monitor/ Sentinel / Security Center / Policies |
| Secure data and applications | 20-25% | Storage/ Database/ Key Vault |

<br />

## 1.2 Quiz
This is an excellent way to gauge if you are prepared for the exam. I would suggest the best time to go through the quizes is when you have gone through all the materials. The credit for these quizes goes to Pete Zerger who prepared these. Note that some answers may be incorrect as things have changed. For example, Azure Key Vault data plane now supports RBAC in addition to access policies.
